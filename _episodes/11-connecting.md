## Secure Connections

The first step in using a cluster is to establish a connection from our laptop
to the cluster. When we are sitting at a computer (or standing, or holding it
in our hands or on our wrists), we have come to expect a visual display with
icons, widgets, and perhaps some windows or applications: a _graphical user
interface_, or GUI. Since computer clusters are remote resources that we
connect to over slow or intermittent interfaces (WiFi and VPNs especially), it
is more practical to use a _command-line interface_, or CLI, to send commands
as plain-text. If a command returns output, it is printed as plain text as
well. The commands we run today will not open a window to show graphical
results.

If you have ever opened the Windows Command Prompt or macOS Terminal, you have
seen a CLI. If you have already taken The Carpentries' courses on the UNIX
Shell or Version Control, you have used the CLI on your _local machine_
extensively. The only leap to be made here is to open a CLI on a _remote machine_,
while taking some precautions so that other folks on the network can't see (or
change) the commands you're running or the results the remote machine sends
back. We will use the Secure SHell protocol (or SSH) to open an encrypted
network connection between two machines, allowing you to send & receive text
and data without having to worry about prying eyes.

SSH clients are usually command-line tools, where you provide the remote
machine address as the only required argument. If your username on the remote
system differs from what you use locally, you must provide that as well. If
your SSH client has a graphical front-end, such as PuTTY or MobaXterm, you will
set these arguments before clicking "connect." From the terminal, you'll write
something like `ssh userName@hostname`, where the argument is just like an
email address: the "@" symbol is used to separate the personal ID from the
address of the remote machine.

When logging in to a laptop, tablet, or other personal device, a username,
password, or pattern are normally required to prevent unauthorized access. In
these situations, the likelihood of somebody else intercepting your password is
low, since logging your keystrokes requires a malicious exploit or physical
access. For systems like {{ site.remote.host }} running an SSH server, anybody
on the network can log in, or try to. Since usernames are often public or easy
to guess, your password is often the weakest link in the security chain. Many
clusters therefore forbid password-based login, requiring instead that you
generate and configure a public-private key pair with a much stronger password.
Even if your cluster does not require it, the next section will guide you
through the use of SSH keys and an SSH agent to both strengthen your security
_and_ make it more convenient to log in to remote systems.

## Log In to the Cluster

Go ahead and open your terminal or graphical SSH client, then log in to the
cluster. Replace `{{ site.remote.user }}` with your username or the one
supplied by the instructors.

```
{{ site.local.prompt }} ssh {{ site.remote.user }}@<machine>.llnl.org
```
{: .language-bash}

You may be asked for your password. Watch out: the characters you type after
the password prompt are not displayed on the screen. Normal output will resume
once you press `Enter`.

You may have noticed that the prompt changed when you logged into the remote
system using the terminal (if you logged in using PuTTY this will not apply
because it does not offer a local terminal). This change is important because
it can help you distinguish on which system the commands you type will be run
when you pass them into the terminal. This change is also a small complication
that we will need to navigate throughout the workshop. Exactly what is displayed
as the prompt (which conventionally ends in `$`) in the terminal when it is
connected to the local system and the remote system will typically be different
for every user. We still need to indicate which system we are entering commands
on though so we will adopt the following convention:

* `{{ site.local.prompt }}` when the command is to be entered on a terminal
  connected to your local computer
* `{{ site.remote.prompt }}` when the command is to be entered on a
  terminal connected to the remote system
* `$` when it really doesn't matter which system the terminal is connected to.

## Looking Around Your Remote Home

Very often, many users are tempted to think of a high-performance computing
installation as one giant, magical machine. Sometimes, people will assume that
the computer they've logged onto is the entire computing cluster. So what's
really happening? What computer have we logged on to? The name of the current
computer we are logged onto can be checked with the `hostname` command. (You
may also notice that the current hostname is also part of our prompt!)

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} hostname
```
{: .language-bash}

```
{{ site.remote.host }}
```
{: .output}

So, we're definitely on the remote machine. Next, let's find out where we are
by running `pwd` to **p**rint the **w**orking **d**irectory.

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} pwd
```
{: .language-bash}

```
{{ site.remote.homedir }}/{{ site.remote.user }}
```
{: .output}

Great, we know where we are! Let's see what's in our current directory:

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} ls
```
{: .language-bash}
```

```
{: .output}

The system administrators may have configured your home directory with some
helpful files, folders, and links (shortcuts) to space reserved for you on
other filesystems. If they did not, your home directory may appear empty. To
double-check, include hidden files in your directory listing:

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} ls -a
```
{: .language-bash}
```
  .            .bashrc           
  ..           .ssh
```
{: .output}

In the first column, `.` is a reference to the current directory and `..` a
reference to its parent (`{{ site.remote.homedir }}`). You may or may not see
the other files, or files like them: `.bashrc` is a shell configuration file,
which you can edit with your preferences; and `.ssh` is a directory storing SSH
keys and a record of authorized connections.

## Using VNC Viewer as an alternative
